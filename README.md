Daytona NFT Project
This project integrates the Daytona platform into an existing application, providing functionalities like creating, listing, and managing NFTs on the Ethereum blockchain.

Features
Ethereum Integration: Allows users to interact with the Ethereum blockchain via MetaMask.
NFT Management: Enables the creation, listing, and management of NFTs.
Web3 Support: Supports Web3 technologies such as ethers.js for interacting with Ethereum.
Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

Node.js (version 16 or higher)
Docker installed and running
MetaMask or any Ethereum wallet extension installed in your browser
Docker Compose (if using Docker for local development)
Installation
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/daytona-nft.git
cd daytona-nft
Install dependencies:

bash
Copy code
npm install --legacy-peer-deps
Build the Docker image:

bash
Copy code
docker build -t daytona-project .
Run the project:

bash
Copy code
docker run -p 3000:3000 daytona-project
Visit the app in your browser at http://localhost:3000.

Usage
Ethereum Integration
To interact with the Ethereum blockchain, make sure that your MetaMask (or another Ethereum wallet) is installed and connected to the correct network.

When the app is loaded, it checks for the Ethereum object (window.ethereum).
If MetaMask is installed and connected, you can interact with the Ethereum blockchain.
NFT Creation and Listing
Create NFT: Users can mint new NFTs by connecting their wallet and submitting the details (e.g., name, image, etc.).
List NFT: Once an NFT is created, it can be listed on the marketplace for others to view and buy.
Troubleshooting
No Ethereum Object: If you encounter the error "No Ethereum object," ensure that MetaMask is installed and unlocked in your browser.
Network Issues: Verify that you are connected to the correct Ethereum network (Mainnet, Rinkeby, etc.) in your wallet.
